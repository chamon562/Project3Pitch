## Honey Sting/Stang (Elevator Pitch) ❥

People are often frustrated by the effort it takes to express their voice in a free and safe zone where they can be heard.
Our App eliminates the feeling of being imprisoned without a voice.
For years, people have trusted society to safe guard freedom of expression however time and time again they have found themselves.. their.. voice restricted.
With Your Voice, is my ›❤ Sound, you can express yourself freely and bring about creative freedom on a platform that not only values your voice but broadcasts it!
